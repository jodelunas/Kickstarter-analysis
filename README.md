# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this analysis is to see how campaign outcomes are affected by their launch date and funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I created a pivot table based on the launch date and outcomes of campaigns. I then created a line chart to see the relationship between them.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I used the countifs function to sort the different outcomes based on different ranges of their fundraising goal. I found the percentage of successful, failed and canceled within these ranges. I then created another line graph to see the relationship between them.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I found the countifs function slightly challenging. I had to change it a few times to make sure I had everything included in the formula.
## Results

- In Outcomes Based on Launch Date, I can conclude that February and May are the best months to start a campaign.

- In Outcomes Based on Goals, I can conclude that campaigns with a goal of $1000 or less are most likely to be successful.

- The limitations in the data set are that there are far to few campaigns with larger goal amounts to know if the conclusion I made was really accurate.

- I could make several more tables and graphs based on other collumns in the data set. Such as, the country it was launched in or if it was a staff pick.
